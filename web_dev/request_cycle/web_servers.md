# Design philosophies of Linux OS
Linux is designed to give the user a maximum of power. This contrasts with Windows and Mac operating systems, where constraints are built into the OS. Although this allows computer-savvy users to do much more, it also means that unknowing users can make costly mistakes.

# Advantages of Virtual Private Servers
A VPS or virtual private server is a chunk of memory that functions like an independent computer. As a server, it is running software like Apache that is designed to respond to HTTP requests. One advantage of using a VPS is that a VPS is easily created and destroyed - meaning that if costly mistakes are made, the server can be recreated. 

In the modern marketplace, VPSs are inexpensive, scalable, and resource-efficient. They also allow you to configure the server however you like, the only exception being that you have no control over the hardware.

# Why not to use Root on Linux
You should not operate Linux from root unless absolutely necessary, because doing so is a security liability. If you happen to commit some error as a user, the worst that will happen is that user becomes compromised. If you are on root, the whole system becomes compromised. The same goes for any viruses or adware you might become victim to.
