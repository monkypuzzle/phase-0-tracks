  <h1>Who is the walrus, really?</h1>
  <p>John Lennon once said, "I am the walrus." Since then, many have echoed his words - not least among them, Steve Buscemi in his turn as the Dude's friend Donny. <em>Was John Lennon <strong>right</strong>?</em> Was he telling the truth? Was he <strong>lying</strong>? Perhaps we'll never know. But what we do know is this.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Walruses have long tusks - really, elongated canines - that serve some unknown purpose</li>
    <li>Walruses have prominent vibrissae - highly sensitive "whiskers" that probably aid in foraging</li>
    <li>Walruses are immense, bloated animals with thick blubbery skins</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We also know these things about John Lennon:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>He was born of human parents - strong evidence suggesting that he was human</li>
    <li>He was prone to making figurative statements, saying for example that "all you need is love", when anybody knows that you also need food and shelter and so on</li>
  </ol>
